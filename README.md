# NSMB2-mega
NSMB2 mod that makes every level open enough for a Mega Mushroom rampage, plus some edits to tileset behavior for more destructibles. Filesystem sorted to line up with AppData\Roaming\Citra.
If it matters, based off the original US release of the game, not the deluxe version.

World 1 fully complete, last I checked.

## Comments on Known Issues
The boss for 1-Tower crashed with the 'shroom, so it was replaced with a bunch of enemies and a flag pole. World 2's Reznor battle worked, though... Memory peak, maybe? For World 1?

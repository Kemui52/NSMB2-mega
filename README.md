# NSMB2-mega
NSMB2 mod that makes every level open enough for a Mega Mushroom rampage, plus some edits to tileset behavior for more destructibles. Filesystem sorted to line up with ``AppData\Roaming\Citra\``. If it matters, based off the original US release of the game, not the deluxe version.

**After defeating a castle boss, press L+Down to disable Mega Mushroom before the level ends! If not, the game will freeze!*

**Complete up to World 2.**

Intended for use with the following cheats at minimum:

*Infinite Mega Mushroom*

*L+Up Mega, L+Down Super Alt.*

## Comments on Known Issues
You must press L+Up every time you enter a level or change areas. Sometimes you will need to press L+Down to enter a door or pipe. *After defeating a castle boss, press L+Down before the level ends! If not, the game will freeze!*

The boss for 1-Tower crashed with the 'shroom, so it was replaced with a bunch of enemies and a flag pole. World 2's Reznor battle worked, though... Memory peak, maybe? For World 1?
